This year has seen great change across many of our campuses in South Africa. Debates are happening and good old fashioned critical engagement is becoming the norm again at universities. It is perhaps a new political awakening. Whether you necessarily align with these movements or not, the grandeur, scope and excitement that comes with events such as the falling of the Rhodes statue and the newly elected DASO SRC at the historically ANC stronghold of the University of Fort Hare, cannot be denied.

Northern Ireland was created in 1921, when Ireland was apportioned between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland by The Government of Ireland Act of the Westminster parliament back in mainland Britain. Unlike Southern Ireland, which would become the Irish Free State in 1922, the majority of Northern Ireland's population were unionists or loyalists, who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom and the majority of these people were the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain. There was however a significant minority who were mostly Catholics and nationalists who sought a united and independent Ireland not controlled by Britain.
e
Our students are engaging and the conversations are happening. A new national identity is forming around the values that so many fought and died for. The values of true freedom, equality and human dignity are at the forefront of what this new generation is working towards. True in the sense that these values are made tangible and a reality to every South African. Young South Africans from all backgrounds are working together in an amazing Rainbow Nation fashion. Even though the days of ‘us’ and ‘them’ are very much with our footprints behind us, there still is  a lot of work to be done.
e
In our short 21 year democratic history one of the biggest topics of discussion in South Africa has been the emigration of qualified South Africans to other countries. In popular media it has been labelled as the so called ‘brain drain’ and in sociology it is studied as human capital flight.
e
This phenomenon despite being regarded as quite a new trend in the world, traces as far back as to when Justinian closed the Platonic Academy in AD 529 and its members took with them precious scrolls of literature, philosophy and science to the Sasanian Empire. In the 17th century Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes and declared Protestantism to be illegal in the Edict of Fontainebleau. With the threat to their religion many French Huguenots fled to surrounding Protestant countries such as England, the Netherlands and Denmark while many others boarded ships to the Dutch colony in the Cape, South Africa with the hope of freedom of religion and a better life.
e
A related topic that is however not as widely discussed is what I like to term ‘internal migration’ in South Africa. At first thought this could be presumed to be people who are moving from other provinces to, for instance, the Western Cape – arguably for a better scenery. This geographic relocation is however not the major challenge of ‘internal migration’.
e
Over the years many South Africans choose the private sector over the public sector and a large amount of qualified South Africans quite literally move from one region or environment (the public sector) to another (the private sector).
e
How I propose to solve these problems in the public sector to make it attractive to all South African students I will delve into at another time.
e
As a country we should create a public sector that is conducive to attract the best and brightest students, as it is here where the South African state needs it the most. The private and public sector should fiercely be competing for the human capital of our best students. Both these sides need good competition between each other where their offers in terms of working environment, salaries and other benefits are fairly equal.

During the last few weeks I have had to answer the question “What exactly is SAWIP?” quite a few times. As I have had to answer this question more frequently I came up with a simple habitual ten word answer.
e
The benefit of having a ten word answer is it simplifies the situation where one gets asked the same question time and time again. We all have ten word answers for a wide array of things in our lives. Most commonly we have a simple ten word answer when people ask us how we are doing. Yet ten word answers ultimately do not tell us much.
e
This ten word answer reminded me quite a lot about a great episode in a series called The West Wing. For those of you who are not West Wing viewers, let me set the scene for you. In the midst of a presidential debate, President Josiah Bartlet, played by Martin Sheen, faces his opponent Governor Robert Ritchie, played by James Brolin. In the scene Governor Ritchie was asked about his tax policy, to which he answered: "We need to cut taxes for one reason - the American people know how to spend their money better than the federal government does."
e
President Bartlet responded by saying: "That's the ten word answer my staff's been looking for two weeks. There it is. Ten-word answers can kill you in political campaigns. They're the tip of the sword. Here's my question: What are the next ten words of your answer? Your taxes are too high? So are mine. Give me the next ten words. How are we going to do it? Give me the ten after that.”
e
I decided to go have a walk on the other side of the political spectrum that I usually find myself in when I specifically think about the economy in South Africa.
e
On 29 April 2015 the University of Pretoria wing of SAWIP had the opportunity and privilege to meet and engage with Mr. Chose Choeu on various issues and topics. Mr. Choeu has been involved in the widest possible array of areas in the South African landscape. Everything from parliament to the American Chamber of Commerce. Something that stuck with me that Mr. Choeu said quite a few times.
e
I have always advocated the role that government has to play in social development, especially in South Africa. I do not for one moment believe that government has no role to play in the economy and that so called “small government” is better. Nor do I deny the success of many left wing economic plans such as the New Deal in the 1930’s that quite literally reversed a worldwide depression.
e
The question I asked myself though is 'What does this role entail, what does it mean and how could it be played by government?'
e
If you look at the African Growth and Opportunity Act, or the AGOA saga that is currently playing out between the United States of America and South Africa you see the role that government has to play quite clearly.
e
In a nutshell, the ongoing AGOA saga is about South Africa and the United States of America intensely deliberating the prices of import and export chickens to and from both countries. This issue may have serious implications for the South African economy in terms of possible job losses and investments. These "issues" may be so extensive that it warrants its own discussion that I will not delve into in this piece.
e
The point that Mr. Choeu made was the classic view that many Republicans in the USA and Conservative party members in the UK hold. Small government is better. The reason for this is that politicians in many cases only think in increments of five years. This is why you need business and private industry in areas that requires long term planning.
e
The obvious problem here lies in the fact that business is always profit driven however, this does not take away from the fact that the most effective way of producing job opportunities is through private industry. The primary duty of government is therefore to create a conducive environment for investment and not to act as an employment agency.
e
Getting back to chickens and the South African economy. Business prefers predictability that is expressed in the economy. Business does not want to compete against a country and its policies that do not welcome investment. Businesses would rather compete with each other on business grounds such as costs and logistics, not on the uncertainty of whether they will be able to own the property on which they create jobs for South Africans.
e
So when our government dabbles in fights over multilateral agreements where we try to further enhance the environment where we attract the attention and investments from international companies - that is when government is fulfilling its main role.
e
I am not of the opinion that we should suddenly take away all the taxes and start an Adam Smith-esque capitalist free-for-all country.
e
All that I am saying is when government fights over chickens that is when they play their most important role.

The University of Pretoria is a multi-faculty research-intensive university with campuses in Pretoria, its surrounds, and in the country’s economic hub, Johannesburg. The University is conveniently situated in close proximity to government departments and major research entities in Pretoria, including the National Research Foundation (NRF) and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).
e
Two of the nine faculties at the University of Pretoria are subdivided into schools, each headed by a chairperson. The available academic programmes are offered in 141 academic departments as well as related centres, institutes and bureaux
e
The University offers 230 different qualifications (degrees, certificates and diplomas). Of the 1 213 academic study programmes, 1 047 are postgraduate programmes.
e
The School of Information Technology comprises three departments, Computer Science, Informatics and Information Science, and is unique in South Africa. The School offers cross disciplinary degrees such as MIT and PhD (IT) and each of the departments also has its own selection of degrees. Welcome to our website and browse through the different options to learn more about the School of IT.
e
The School of Information Technology at the University of Pretoria is a unique institution for tertiary education in the field of information technology.
e
Formed in April 1998, the School consists of the three academic Departments of Computer Science, Informatics and Information Science. Close links also exist with the Department of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering. Three-year degree programmes and postgraduate degrees are offered in each of the three disciplines.  The MIT degree opens exciting study prospects to IT-practitioners. Apart from being a capstone degree for the practitioner, it also leads to the PhD (IT).
e
This funding from Carnegie enables the Department to offer a fully funded specialised two year coursework degree at Masters level in Information Technology as from January 2011, in cooperation with the other departments within the School of Information Technology and local and international partners. The project will empower the next generation librarians and faculty of Library and Information Science Schools from Africa to support the next generation academics and researchers.
e
Modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) develop at a very fast rate. This is happening at the level of hardware, software and networks. Africa, and specifically Sub-Saharan Africa, has to a large extent been excluded from this revolution, with some notable exceptions. This is evident from many international surveys which report about the lack of sophisticated computers, lack of connectivity, lack of skills etc., and the resultant lack of access to the latest research information.
e
Technology alone will not make the required difference – skills are needed to empower workers to use the technology effectively and optimally. This is especially true in libraries, both at the technology and the skills level – information professionals need the technology and the skills to support the next generation of researchers and academics in Africa. This therefore requires a well-managed infrastructure and knowledge of information resources that are available. However, it also requires knowledge of the latest software that can improve productivity and an understanding of the impact of the technology on the working environment.
e
This programme therefore aims at making a difference at the knowledge and skills level of academic librarians and faculty in Library and Information Science (LIS) schools in Sub-Saharan Africa. By aiming the programme at practicing librarians the programme hopes to make an immediate difference in the optimal use of the technology in libraries, thereby also empowering them to support the next generation of academics and researchers in Africa more effectively and efficiently in their research endeavors
e
Each focus area is associated with one or more IFIP Work Groups. These research focus areas incorporate our previous focus areas (namely, theoretical aspects of informatics, the socio-economic impact and implications of information systems and information technology, information technology in the service of the organization and society, and knowledge discovery from data to enhance organizational decision-making) as well as other aspects and approaches that are common to them.
e
In line with its mission of pursuing recognition and excellence in its core functions of research, teaching and learning, as well as integrating engagement with society and communities, the University of Pretoria consolidates many of its research, teaching and engagement activities in 100 institutes, centres and units in the faculties. 
e
A significant number of South African Research Chairs (funded by the South African Research Chairs Initiative), as well as research chairs funded by industry, are housed in these institutes, centres and units. Research themes spanning expertise across departments or faculties are often also often based in these institutes, centres and units.
e
(International Relations) is a three-year full-time study programme. The purpose of this study programme is to develop skills in order to comprehend the changing nature of contemporary world politics. The study programme will enable innovative and proactive participation in the management of international issues and challenges in career situations in both the public and private sectors. In addition basic political analysis and communication skills are developed.
e
Prospective students in Grade 12 (final school-year) must use their final Grade 11 year mark (promotion mark) to apply. No Grade 12 marks will be considered for provisional admission. Please note that prospective students who have already left school should use their NSC/IEB* Certificate to apply. Additional selection criteria are applicable in applications for selection programmes.
e
Provisional admission is granted on the results obtained in the final Grade 11 examination (promotion mark). Please note that the final Grade 12 results remain the determining factor with regard to admission. Also note that compliance with the minimum requirements does not necessarily guarantee admission to any study programme.
e
The calculation of an Admission Point Score (APS) is based on a candidate’s achievement in any SIX recognised NSC 20-credit subjects (including subjects from the non-designated subject list, eg CAT, Tourism, Hospitality Studies and Civil, Electrical & Mechanical Technology, etc), by using the NSC seven-point rating scale. Life Orientation is a 10-credit subject and may not be used for calculating the APS. Life Orientation is also not a faculty-specific subject requirement.
e
A dissertation on a topic approved by the Dean on the recommendation of the Head of department must be submitted following the approval of a complete research proposal. A literature study is not acceptable.
e
Subject to the stipulations of General Regulations G.30 to G.62 a candidate can be admitted if he/she complies with the following requirements:
e
The University has seven campuses as well as a number of other sites of operation, such as the Pretoria Academic Hospital. Central administration is located at the Hatfield Campus.
e
